### About Myself

My name is Dudi Levy.
I have my stack of experience in software engineering, product management, and people leadership.

*Technology* for me is a tool where you can create and make amazing products.</br>
*Product* for me is to create a something that will change, enrich or make an impact on other people lives.</br>
And *leadership* is about empowering people working together towards a greater goal, where each of them alone can not achieve.
