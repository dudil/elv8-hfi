### [www.netlify.com](https://www.netlify.com)

Netlify is unique hosting service mainly intended to serve static sites.
What I like about them is that they put their focus on static sites and web app.
That means you mainly can expect a secure and global CDN with great CI/CD service integrated.

While they are working and scaling with other features, focusing on the above means they are excelling with this specific features. Their CI/CD is flawless, fast and reliable and their CDN is fast to response and serve.
Above all I must praise their excellent documentations. Usually with hosting, cloud, VPS services you find horrible, cluttered and confusing documentation if any (I'm looking at you [AWS](/blog/amazon-product-advertising-api/)!).  

This blog is hosted on Netlify, and it is not only easy to use it also fun.
