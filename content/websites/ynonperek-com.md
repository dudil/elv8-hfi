Ynon is one of the most talented software engineers I had the pleasure to work with.  
He operates a successful online training site (in Hebrew) named [ToCode](https://tocode.co.il).  
  
Ynon blog is a paradise to every developer who respects his profession. You will find there cover for new technologies and concepts, in-depth review of web technologies and security practices.  
But for me, the best part is his in-depth programming languages review and comparison.  
(Even though for some strange reason he prefers Perl on Python...)
