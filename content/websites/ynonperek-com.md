Ynon blog is a great resources for the constant learning developer.  
You will find in his blog cover for new technologies and concepts, 
review of web technologies and security practices.  
But for me, the best part is his in-depth programming languages review and comparison.  
Ynon guides you through the different languages implementation, with insights that gives you better understanding of the underling mechanics of programing languages and platforms.
