### [gohugo.io](https://gohugo.io)

Hugo is a [static site generator](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2017/05/25/top-ten-static-site-generators-of-2017/) build using the go programing language.  
Now, for those of you not familiar with [GO](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2017/05/25/top-ten-static-site-generators-of-2017/), it is a language built specifically around performance and speed.  
No surprise then, that Hugo is very fast in building up websites that includes massive amount of content.  

My take, and what I love about Hugos are few things:  
1. It is very well documented, and clear documentation is something the developers take seriously  
2. It has an active and supportive community in terms of support, bug fixing and new features  
3. There are many different themes you could choose from to set-up your site in minutes  
4. Customization and adaptation are almost endless and limitless. 

So if you are considering building your own blog or website, I definitely urge you to give Hugo a good try.  
From my own experience you won't be disappointed!
