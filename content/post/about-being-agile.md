## Here at "X" We are Fully Agile

Quite often, I have the oppertunity to hear this phrase. Could be the a team leader the CTO or even the CEO.

*Surprisingly* though, it is also often I hear that the same agile teams are late on schedules, won't deliver quality products and are rearrly if any, able to improve their own infrastructure.

Why is it suprising? becuase agile was set to target that same issues we were noticing when working waterfall.

So are these teams fail to implment agile? Or is it agile failing to keep its promise? Maybe we need to set a new methdology? or maybe it is just a better practice and a matter of experience?

I don't think I have all the answers ready, but on this post I'll try to examine recurring points of failure when working with agile. Might be, these points condredict some of the "agile" concepts - and I will touch this issue as well.

## But First - What Does it Mean to be Agile?

The simple answer is that there is no simple answer.

to be honest, I was amazed to see how many different point of views you can get on that subject.

Some real life examples:
- For a CTO - this could be how he would like to manage his SDLC (software development life cycle). It makes it a common stratgey and process of how everyone should work together. It is a ready manuscript you only need to download twick a bit and run. Letting you focus on what is realy important.

- For a CPO - this is the magic solution to push more features to production. Agile is about constant delivery and having 100 production deliveries per day in assence meanss much more feaures and content.

- For a Scrum Master - it is a religion you must follow. Everything not following
