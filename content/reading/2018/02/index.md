## Welcome to the first issue of my reading list
Here I will collect links to great and useful articles I've read during the month.  
You can see this as my own "monthly favorites list"  
Feel free to share your own on the comment section below and I will add it to the list!  

### This month will be mostly dedicated to posts that helped me building this website
As such you will find here articles related to website building, SEO, hosting services etc.  

### [How to properly set your Hugo Website for SEO](https://keithpblog.org/post/hugo-website-seo/)
Great and useful post with very simple and clear instructions for SEO dummies (like me...)
